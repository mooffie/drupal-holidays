The main use of this module is to print dates in non-Gregorian calendar
systems. E.g., use this module if you want to print Hebrew dates (and
holidays).

This module primarily provides API. Therefore it has scant user interface.
For usage instructions and examples, see:

- The 'API.txt' in the lib/ folder.

- The handbook page, at http://drupal.org/node/XXXXXX

Enable the 'holidays_demo' module to see this module put to some use. You'll
find a new menu item, pointing to ?q=holidays, which will print a nice calendar.
